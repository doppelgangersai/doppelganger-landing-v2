            (&quot;Doppelgangers.ai&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;).
            Your Doppelgangers AI works by training on your private digital
            memory vault, including photos, text and other uploaded materials,
            referred to as a Data Vault. This allows your AI to learn more about
            you and better predict your needs and preferences. The larger your
            Data Vault is, the more information your Doppelgangers AI can
            remember about you (collectively, the &quot;Doppelgangers.ai
            Services&quot; or &quot;Doppelgangers AI&quot;). Data Vault data is
            owned by the user and will not be sold to third parties or used for
            interest-based advertising.

            <p className='text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed'>
              You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in
              California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one
              that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either
              specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This
              Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of
              the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws
              principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences
              a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the
              preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any
              arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
              shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§
              1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on
              Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
              excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
              federal and state courts located in San Diego County, California
              for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive
              or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
              prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
              violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents,
              or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth
              in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional
              relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San
              Diego County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an
              arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that
              the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
            </p>

            <p className='text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed'>
              Arbitration. Read this section carefully because it requires the
              parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which
              you can seek relief from Company. For any dispute with Company,
              you agree to first contact us at support@Doppelgangers.ai and
              attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely
              event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has
              with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any
              claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for
              injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising
              out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the
              breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively,
              &quot;Claims&quot;), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the
              Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS,
              except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at
              www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara
              County, California, unless you and Company agree otherwise. If you
              are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be
              responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and
              arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award
              rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
              reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and reasonable costs for expert
              and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service
              for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee
              for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and
              successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award
              rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration,
              your reasonable attorney&apos;s fees, and your reasonable costs
              for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small
              claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in
              arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to
              engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on
              the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
              of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed
              as preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable
              relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or
              threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our
              data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary
              rights.

              Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. With respect to all persons and
              entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the
              Service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all Claims
              must be brought in the parties&apos; individual capacity, and not

              arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may
              not consolidate more than one person&apos;s Claims. You agree
              that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Company are each
              waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
              action, collective action, private attorney general action, or

            </h2>
            <p className='text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed'>
              Mobile Applications. We may make available software to access the
              Service via a mobile device (&quot;Mobile Applications&quot;). To

              compatible with the Mobile Applications. Company does not warrant
              that the Mobile Applications will be compatible with your mobile
              device. You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile
              Applications and may incur additional charges from your wireless
              provider for these services. You agree that you are solely
              responsible for any such charges. Company hereby grants you a
              non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a
              compiled code copy of the Mobile Applications for one Company User
              Account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for
              your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile
              or reverse engineer the Mobile Applications, except to the extent
              that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent,
              lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer
              the Mobile Applications to any third party or use the Mobile

              with security-related features of the Mobile Applications,
              features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content
              accessible through the Mobile Applications, or features that
              enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Applications; or (v)
              delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the
              Mobile Applications. You acknowledge that Company may from time to

              Applications that you are using on your mobile device. You consent
              to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that
              the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all such
              upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the
              Mobile Applications is covered by the applicable open source or
              third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code.
              The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile
              Applications or any copy thereof, and Company or its third-party

              addition, the Mobile Applications may be subject to the import and
              export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all
